# Research Design and Implementation Flow

This project visualizes a research workflow using a modern, visually appealing flowchart with Mermaid.js.

## Features
- **Mermaid.js Flowchart**: Illustrates the phases of research design, data preparation, collection, analysis, outcomes, and dissemination.
- **Custom Color Scheme**: Uses a soft, modern palette (light blue, sand, and pastel blue) for clarity and visual appeal.
- **Responsive Layout**: Fits large screens and is easy to present.

## File Structure
- `index.html` — Main file containing the Mermaid flowchart and styling.
- `images/` — (Add images here for portfolio or project visuals as needed.)

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. The flowchart will render automatically. You can edit the Mermaid diagram or styles directly in the HTML file to customize your flow.

## Customization
- **Colors**: Adjust the Mermaid `classDef` sections in `index.html` to change node colors.
- **Phases/Nodes**: Edit the Mermaid code to add or remove phases and sub-nodes to match your workflow.
- **Images**: Place any relevant images in the `images/` directory for use in your portfolio or documentation.

## Dependencies
- [Mermaid.js](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/) (loaded via CDN)

## Credits
- Color inspiration and design adjustments based on user feedback and provided palettes.
